# Hi, I'm Umesh! 👋


## MEAL FINDER using Vanilla Javascript

The Meals Finder is a application designed to provide users with a variety of meal recipes along with detailed instructions on how to prepare them. It offers a wide range of dishes categorized into different meal types such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Users can explore recipes, save their favorites, and even create shopping lists based on selected recipes.

# Problem Statement
Create a meal app to store and search meals. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).
